This project involves the design and simulation of a secure network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. The topology includes routers, switches, servers, and end-user devices, configured to support reliable communication while enforcing network security controls.
Several Layer 2 security mechanisms are implemented to protect the network. 
Port Security is configured with MAC address sticky learning, allowing switches to dynamically learn and retain legitimate MAC addresses. 
The restrict violation mode is applied to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing the network while logging security violations. Additionally, BPDU Guard is used to block rogue switch connections, and IP Source Guard is implemented to mitigate IP spoofing attacks.
This project demonstrates practical understanding of network design, switch security, and traffic control, making it suitable for academic coursework and foundational network security practice.
